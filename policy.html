    <ul>
      <li>Have you or a loved one ever experienced unfair treatment from a care provider?</li>
      <li>Was the care provided in a respectful and inclusive manner?</li>
      <li>Were language or accessibility needs met during the care process?</li>
      <li>Do you feel our agency fosters a respectful and inclusive environment?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This form is for awareness and internal training purposes only. No personal data is required unless voluntarily provided.</p>
